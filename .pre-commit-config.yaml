To clean up Google Cloud Rot and maintain a secure environment, follow these steps:

1. Audit Service Accounts and Keys
Run gcloud iam service-accounts list to list all service accounts.
For each service account, run gcloud iam service-accounts keys list to review keys.
Delete any stale or unused keys using gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete <KEY_ID>.

2. Check for Expired or Unused OAuth Tokens
In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts.
Identify accounts with unused credentials and remove them.

3. Remove Unused APIs and Services
List enabled services with gcloud services list --enabled.
Disable services you no longer need using gcloud services disable <SERVICE_NAME>.

4. Clean Up Storage and Compute Resources
Identify unused buckets with gsutil ls and delete unnecessary ones.
Review compute instances with gcloud compute instances list and remove any that are inactive.

5. Automate Monitoring
Use Cloud Asset Inventory and Cloud Logging to monitor resource usage.
Schedule regular audits to detect and prevent credential or resource rot.

6. Set Policies to Avoid Future Rot
Enforce IAM key rotation and lifecycle rules for buckets.
Use Organization Policies to limit service account sprawl and ensure security compliance.

By following these steps, you can keep your Google Cloud environment clean, secure, and free from stale resources or credentials.
